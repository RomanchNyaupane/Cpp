//this program given below works even without including iostream try it
// int main(){
//     int a=1;
//     int b=2;
// }

//we can still use printf() function in c++

/*
difference between main function in c and c++

1. in c main returns void by default. in c++ main returns int by default
2. main in c can be called by other functions but in c++, main cannot be called by another function



namespace: namespace is a declarative region that provides a scope to the identifiers inside it.
namespaces are used to organize code into logical group and to prevent name collisions that can occour when the code base includes multiple libraries
*/
//in c++ only int main should be used
